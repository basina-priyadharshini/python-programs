<!-- GENERAL -->
<div class="section" id="general">
<h1>General</h1>

<div class="question">What is Bitcoin?</div>
<div class="answer">
Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely 
digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is 
powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, 
Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most 
prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.
</div>

<div class="question">Who created Bitcoin?</div>
<div class="answer">
Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "cryptocurrency", which was 
first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the 
idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and 
transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and 
proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi 
Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. 
The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.<br>
Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to 
misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and 
software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the 
code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current 
developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by 
others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's 
inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper.
</div>

<div class="question">Who controls the Bitcoin network?</div>
<div class="answer">
Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. 
Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are 
improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all 
users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible 
with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin 
can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users 
and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.
</div>

<div class="question">How does Bitcoin work?</div>
<div class="answer">
    From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer 
    program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and 
    receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.
</div>
<!-- LEGAL -->
<div class="section" id="legal">
<h1>Legal</h1>

<div class="question">Is Bitcoin legal?</div>
<div class="answer">
To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions.
However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. 
Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.<br>
Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses 
with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. 
For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States 
Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.
</div>

<div class="question">Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?</div>
<div class="answer">
Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, 
credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. 
Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are 
often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.<br>
Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act 
as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are 
completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot 
receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible 
and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss 
using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.
</div>
</div>

<!-- ECONOMY -->
<div class="section" id="economy">
<h1>Economy</h1>

<div class="question">How are bitcoins created?</div>
<div class="answer">
New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called "mining". 
This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. 
Bitcoin miners are processing transactions and securing the network using specialized 
hardware and are collecting new bitcoins in exchange.<br>
The Bitcoin protocol is designed in such a way that new bitcoins are created at a fixed rate. 
This makes Bitcoin mining a very competitive business. When more miners join the network, it 
becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and miners must seek efficiency to cut their 
operating costs. No central authority or developer has any power to control or manipulate the 
system to increase their profits. Every Bitcoin node in the world will reject anything that 
does not comply with the rules it expects the system to follow.
</div>

<div class="question">Why do bitcoins have value?</div>
<div class="answer">
Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the 
characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, 
and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical 
properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). 
In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for 
a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be 
measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's 
value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.
</div>

<div class="question">What determines bitcoin’s price?</div>
<div class="answer">
    The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, 
    the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of 
    bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which 
    means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin 
    is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant 
    amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.
</div>
</div>

<!-- TRANSACTIONS -->
<div class="section" id="transactions">
<h1>Transactions</h1>

<div class="question">Why do I have to wait for confirmation?</div>
<div class="answer">
Receiving notification of a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there is a delay 
before the network begins to confirm your transaction by including it in a block. A confirmation 
means that there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent 
to anyone else and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been included in one block, 
it will continue to be buried under every block after it, which will exponentially consolidate this 
consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Each confirmation takes between a few 
seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a fee or 
is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer. Every user is free to 
determine at what point they consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but 6 confirmations is 
often considered to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit card transaction.
</div>

<div class="question">What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?</div>
<div class="answer">
This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins 
are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger 
that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet 
client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with 
any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they 
were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins.
</div>
</div>

<!-- MINING -->
<div class="section" id="mining">
<h1>Mining</h1>

<div class="question">What is Bitcoin mining?</div>
<div class="answer">
Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, 
and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data 
center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all 
countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as "mining" 
as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins. 
Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services 
required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued.
</div>

<div class="question">How does Bitcoin mining work?</div>
<div class="answer">
Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware.
 Mining software listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network 
 and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners 
 perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction 
 processing, and newly created bitcoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula.
</div>
</div>

<!-- SECURITY -->
<div class="section" id="security">
<h1>Security</h1>

<div class="question">Is Bitcoin secure?</div>
<div class="answer">
The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track
 record, and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project 
 in the world. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files 
 that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is 
 pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ 
 sound security practices to protect their money or use service providers that offer good 
 levels of security and insurance against theft or loss.
</div>

<div class="question">Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?</div>
<div class="answer">
The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after 
its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, 
security flaws have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. 
Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed 
with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more 
Bitcoin is gaining maturity.
